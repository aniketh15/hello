            <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 2;">Jeff Bezos founded Amazon from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[15] on July 5, 1994. It started as an online marketplace for books but expanded to sell electronics, software, video games, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States by market capitalization.[16] In 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods Market for US$13.4 billion, which substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[17] In 2018, its two-day delivery service, Amazon Prime, surpassed 100 million subscribers worldwide.<a href="https://www.amazon.in/?ie=UTF8&ext_vrnc=hi&tag=googhydrabk-21&ascsubtag=_k_EAIaIQobChMI_tnv1p2U8AIVIjNyCh3NlAZ5EAAYASAAEgIAgvD_BwE_k_&ext_vrnc=hi&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_tnv1p2U8AIVIjNyCh3NlAZ5EAAYASAAEgIAgvD_BwE" target="_blank">Amazon page.</a></p>

            <p>
              Mathematicians seek and use patterns[8][9] to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature.

            <p>Benefits of math</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Math is useful.
                <p>Virtually everyone needs to be able to do some mathematics. Some fields (such as the sciences and engineering) require quite a bit of mathematical knowledge. Don’t rely on this answer, though, to convince your friends that math is important: Though these observations are accurate, they won’t convince a music major that she should study calculus.</p></li>
                <li>Math is fun.
                <p>Most people have experienced the pleasure of getting the right answer to a difficult mathematics problem. It is the same pleasure we get from figuring out a puzzle. This answer may be more true for people who are successful in their mathematical pursuits: People probably won’t find a lot of pleasure in something that they struggle with.</p></li>
                <li>Math trains the mind
                <p>I don’t claim that every problem one encounters in life can be solved mathematically. But I do believe that people benefit from exposure to mathematical logic. The process of breaking things down—here’s what we know, then here’s what logically follows from that, and so on—and working our way to a logical conclusion is something that everyone can benefit from.</p></li>
